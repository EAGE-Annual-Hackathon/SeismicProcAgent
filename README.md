# SeismicProcAgent
The open source demo for seismic data process AI agent using MCP and LLMs.

## Quick Start
### Environment Requirements
* `Python`: 3.10+
* `npm/npx`: 10.9.2+

SeismicProcAgent is developed in Python. To ensure a smooth setup process, we recommend using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to manage the Python environment and dependencies. In the terminal we execute:
```
# MacOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
Then download and install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) according to your operating system. Be sure to restart your terminal afterwards to ensure the `uv/npm/npx` command is recognized.

### Installation
```
# Clone the repository
git clone
```
